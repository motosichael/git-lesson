basics using version control

first day of msse bootcamp

to make commit (or "version" or "checkpoint) of your files,
follow this procedure:

1. Make changes to project that like to keep
2. When you have changes, tell git you are ready to create a commit by adding files to the staging area using "git add filename"
3. create a checkpoint ("commit") using 'git commit -m "message what you did"
